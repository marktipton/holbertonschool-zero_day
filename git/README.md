# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General

1. **What is source code management?**
   - Source code management (SCM) is the process of tracking and controlling changes to the software code. It involves version control, maintaining historical versions, and managing changes to the codebase over time.

2. **What is Git?**
   - Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.

3. **What is GitHub?**
   - GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides a collaborative environment for developers to host, review, and manage their code.

4. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**
   - Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a platform that provides cloud-based hosting for Git repositories. Git is a tool for managing code versions locally and remotely, while GitHub facilitates collaboration, code sharing, and project management.

5. **How to create a repository?**
   - A repository (repo) can be created using the `git init` command in a local directory or through the GitHub website by clicking the "New" repository button.

6. **What is a README?**
   - A README is a text file (usually `README.md` in Markdown format) that provides information about a project, including its purpose, how to install and use it, and any other relevant details.

7. **How to write good READMEs?**
   - Good READMEs are clear, concise, and provide all necessary information for understanding and using the project. They should include a project description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant details.

8. **How to commit?**
   - To commit changes, use the `git commit -m "commit message"` command after staging the changes with `git add`. This saves the current state of the project with a descriptive message.

9. **How to write helpful commit messages?**
   - Helpful commit messages are clear, concise, and describe the purpose of the changes. They should explain what was changed and why.

10. **How to push code?**
    - Use the `git push` command to upload local repository changes to a remote repository on GitHub.

11. **How to pull updates?**
    - Use the `git pull` command to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository to your local repository.

12. **How to create a branch?**
    - Use the `git branch branch_name` command to create a new branch, and switch to it using `git checkout branch_name` or `git switch branch_name`.

13. **How to merge branches?**
    - Use the `git merge branch_name` command to merge changes from one branch into the current branch.

14. **How to work as collaborators on a project?**
    - Collaborators can work on a project by cloning the repository, creating branches, making changes, and pushing their work to GitHub. They can use pull requests to propose changes and code reviews to discuss and improve the code.

15. **Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo?**
    - Files that should appear in your repo include source code, documentation, configuration files, and other project-related files. Files that should not appear include sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys), temporary files, and files generated by the build process. Use a `.gitignore` file to specify which files and directories to ignore.
